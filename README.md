## **Synopsis**  
Webpack currently lacks a systematic approach to benchmark performance in CI. Manual benchmarking can be inconsistent, making it hard to detect regressions early. This project aims to introduce an **automated benchmarking pipeline** in CI that tracks Webpack's performance on each PR and blocks significant slowdowns.

### **Objectives:**
- Implement a **Benchmarking Infrastructure** to measure Webpack's performance.
- Integrate benchmarking with **GitHub Actions** for automated CI-based testing.
- Develop **Performance Regression Alerts** to notify maintainers when a PR introduces a slowdown.

---

## **Benefits to the Community**  
- **Prevents Performance Regressions:** CI automatically blocks PRs that degrade performance.
- **Provides Clear Performance Insights:** Contributors receive benchmarking feedback directly in their PRs.
- **Reduces Manual Work:** Maintainers no longer need to manually test Webpack’s performance.
- **Enhances Stability:** Ensures Webpack stays optimized across updates.

---

## **Deliverables**  
- **Automated Benchmarking Infrastructure:** Scripted performance tests for Webpack.
- **CI-Based Benchmark Execution:** Runs benchmarks automatically on every PR.
- **Performance Alerts & Thresholds:** PRs exceeding performance limits trigger warnings.
- **Comprehensive Documentation:** Setup guide, usage instructions, and best practices.

---

## **Solution**  

### **1. Benchmarking Infrastructure**  
We need a structured benchmarking setup that accurately measures Webpack’s performance.

#### **Implementation Steps:**  
- Use **Node.js performance hooks** (`performance.now()`) to track build times.
- Measure **bundle size, memory usage, and build time**.
- Store baseline performance metrics to compare against PR benchmarks.

#### **Code Sketch:**  
```javascript
const { performance } = require('perf_hooks');
const webpack = require('webpack');

function runBenchmark(config) {
    const compiler = webpack(config);
    const startTime = performance.now();
    compiler.run((err, stats) => {
        if (err) console.error(err);
        const endTime = performance.now();
        console.log(`Build time: ${(endTime - startTime).toFixed(2)} ms`);
    });
}
```

---

### **2. CI Integration**  
Benchmarks must run in CI on every PR to detect slowdowns automatically.

#### **Implementation Steps:**  
- Add a **GitHub Action workflow** to execute benchmarks on each PR.
- Fetch baseline performance data from **previous Webpack releases**.
- Compare new results and fail the PR if degradation exceeds a threshold.

#### **Code Sketch:**  
```yaml
name: Webpack Benchmark
on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  benchmark:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Run Benchmark
        run: node scripts/benchmark.js
      - name: Compare Results
        run: node scripts/compare-benchmark.js
```

### **3. Performance Regression Alerts**  
To prevent slow PRs from being merged, we need an alerting system.

#### **Implementation Steps:**  
- If build time increases by **>10%**, post a warning in the PR.
- If **>20% degradation**, block the PR from merging.
- Maintain a **performance dashboard** for long-term tracking.

#### **Code Sketch:**  
```javascript
const baselineTime = 1000; // Baseline in ms
const newBuildTime = 1200;

if (newBuildTime > baselineTime * 1.1) {
    console.log("⚠️ Warning: Build time increased! Check for regressions.");
}
if (newBuildTime > baselineTime * 1.2) {
    throw new Error("❌ Performance regression detected! PR cannot be merged.");
}
```

## **Schedule**  
I will dedicate **15-20 hours per week** to this project. **50%** of the time will be spent coding, and **50%** on testing, documentation, and discussions.

### **Community Bonding (May 20 - June 17)**  
- Understand Webpack’s benchmarking needs.
- Research best practices for CI-based performance tracking.
- Discuss implementation details with mentors.

### **Phase 1: Benchmarking Infrastructure (June 17 - July 15)**  
- Develop scripts to measure Webpack’s build time, bundle size, and memory usage.
- Establish baseline performance values.
- Test locally and refine.

### **Phase 2: CI Integration (July 15 - August 5)**  
- Integrate benchmark execution into **GitHub Actions**.
- Compare results against baselines.
- Ensure reliable pass/fail conditions.

### **Phase 3: Regression Alerts & Finalization (August 5 - August 26)**  
- Implement **performance alerts** in PRs.
- Create a performance dashboard (optional stretch goal).
- Final testing, documentation, and deployment.

## **Expected Outcomes**  
By the end of this project, Webpack will have:  
✅ **A fully automated benchmarking system** running in CI.  
✅ **Real-time PR performance analysis** to detect slowdowns early.  
✅ **A transparent performance history**, helping maintain Webpack’s speed.  

---

## **Future Possibilities**  
- Extend benchmarks to include **real-world Webpack projects**.
- Add **historical tracking** to visualize performance trends.
- Integrate Slack/Discord notifications for real-time alerts.

---

## **Why Me?**  
I have experience with **Node.js, GitHub Actions, and CI/CD automation**. I am passionate about optimizing build tools and have previously worked on CI-based automation projects. My skills align well with Webpack’s needs, and I am eager to contribute to its long-term stability and performance.
